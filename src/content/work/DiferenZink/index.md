- Replaced a web made with Yii to <b>Yii2</b><br/><br/>
- Reduced the loading speed and reducing the queries that they have on their <b>DB</b> significantly improving accuracy<br/><br/>

  <b>Highlight</b>:<br/>
  My understanding of the Web development, the build process and macros vastly improved during this work term. I will never forget my first job as a programmer :)
